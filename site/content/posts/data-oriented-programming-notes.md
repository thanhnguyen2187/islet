## About The Book

> *Data-Oriented Programming* was written to help developers reduce the
> complexity of the systems they build. The ideas in this book are mostly
> applicable to systems that manipulate information--systems like frontend
> applications, backend web servers, or web services.

> Who should read this book?
>
> For object-oriented programming developers, some ideas presented in this book
> might take them out of their comfort zone and require them to unlearn some of
> the programming paradigms they feel so much at ease with.
>
> For functional programming developers, this book will be a little easier to
> digest but should deliver some nice surprises as well.
