I often introduced myself as a "backend spectrum Software Engineer", and
(surprisingly) did accumulate quite a few knowledge on the landscape. My professional
languages were Python and Golang mostly, but I can totally imagine working in
backend of other languages is going to have the same "structure". In this post,
I am going to show you the often be "met" parts/ideas of a backend project, in
order to help you visualize a general "anatomy", or "structure" of such
projects.

Let us get started.

## Layered Architecture

Working in backend, we encounter quite a few architectures: Clean Architecture,
Hexagonal Architecture, Onion Architecture, etc. One common pattern for them is:
being multilayered, however.

| Clean Architecture | Onion Architecture | Column3 |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| Item1              | Item1              | Item1   |
