As you may (or may not) have known it, I am a fan of fantasy novels. Another
strange fact: I am an aphantasiast (one who has aphantasia; or who is literally
cannot picture anything in their head). Foggy images floats through my head as
words flows. I still can get lost in the words if the story is good enough,
however. The process is quite fun.

My recent "book hunting" led me to "Master of Sorrows" and "Master Artificer",
which are the titles of two books in a series called "The Silent Gods" by Justin
Call. I spent 1.5 days going through the series, and opened my computer just to
write this review.

In short, "The Slient Gods" is incredible.

The two books are told in third person, mostly follow Annev, who is a
"traditional" "chosen one": clueless at his origin; having a good sense of
honor; fighting smart but not book smart. He has a mysterious mentor, which is
also a father figure named Sodar. Annev is bullied by an upper class man named Fyn,
and falls for Myjun, the daughter of the magic (anti-magic to be precise)
school's princple.

World building of the series is thick with magic and mythologies. Mysteries
unravel themselves slowly, keep you suspended, wanting to know more. Everyone in
the story is a big shade of gray. Even the ones that we "supposed" to hate do
have their own vision, own motives, and own reasons. We understand them, but do
not necessary accept their actions.

"The Silent Gods" is not for everyone, however. Slow pacing can be liked by one
and disliked by another. The grayness of the series means sometimes, we cannot
even root for Annev, the protagonist, on his actions. Rich, detailed, and
multi-layered world building can potentially overwhelm the readers. "Master
Artificer", the second book of the series, splits its focuses to multiple
"important" characters, which can be distracting and confusing (I myself
sometimes skip an entire chapter for the reason).

To conclude the review, "The Silent Gods" is for you if your taste is:

- Mystery
- Dark Fantasy
- Realistic Characters
- Complex World Building

I really look forward to seeing how would Annev be "Master of The Fallen" in the
next book (sorry for the minor spoiler!).
