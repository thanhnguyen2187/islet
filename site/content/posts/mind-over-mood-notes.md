I found a recommendation on HackerNews on books for CBT (cognitive behavioral
therapy) to improve your thinking and emotional controlling. My thought was: why
not?

## Change How You Feel by Changing the Way You Think

I was not to sold on this part of the book's title. It was probably because I
was more on the side of "accepting my feelings", and "everything happens for a
reason". I always try to find that "reason". Thinking about it again, maybe
"accepting my feelings" is the right part, but "finding the reason". I had the
spark that it may not be that big of a matter to find the reason. Let feelings
be feelings.

Let us hope that I will find something useful in this book.

Skimmed through the table of contents, and the following parts I found something
interesting already:

> - Understanding Your Depression
> - Understanding Your Anxiety
> - Understanding Your Anger, Guilt, and Shame
> - Maintaining Your Gains and Experiencing More Happiness

> *Mind Over Mood* is a hands-on workbook that teaches CBT skills in a clear,
> step-by-step format. It is designed to help readers understand their problems
> better and make fundamental changes in their lives, either with the aid of a
> therapist or on their own.

## How _ *Mind Over Mood* _ Can Help You

> For an oyster, an irritant becomes the seed for something new and beautiful.
> Similarly, *Mind Over Mood* will help you develop something new: beneficial
> skills to lead you out of your current discomfort. The skills you learn by
> using this book will help you feel better and will continue to have value in
> your life long after your original problems are gone.

So what I found here is: the book is going to teach me "skills", probably CBT
related, to:

- Understand my problems better
- Make changes
- Lead me out of my current discomfort

---

> *Mind Over Mood* teaches you strategies, methods, and skills that have been
> shown to be helpful with mood problems such as depression, anxiety, panic,
> jealousy, guilt, and shame. The skills taught in this book can also help you
> solve relationship problems, handle stress better, improve your self-esteem,
> become less fearful, and grow more confident.

> "Cognitive" refers to what we think and how we think. Cognitive-behavioral
> therapists emphasize understanding the thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors
> connected to our moods, physical experiences, and events in our lives.

What the author wrote became kind of cool after I made the comparing table:

| Understanding | Connected to           |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| - Thoughts    | - Moods                |
| - Beliefs     | - Physical Experiences |
| - Behaviors   | - Events               |

---

> *Mind Over Mood* teaches you to identify and understand the connections among
> your thoughts, mood, behaviors, and physical reactions in everyday situations
> like this one, as well as during major events of your life.

There was an example, but I did not type it. The next persuasions sounded as
compelling as ever:

> You will learn to:
> - Think about yourself and situations in more helpful ways, and to
> - change the thinking patterns and behaviors that keep you stuck in
>   distressing moods and relationships.
> - [...] discover how to make changes in your life when your thoughts alert you
>   to problems that need to be solved.

On knowing "how well are you taught by the book":

> In the early weeks, you will learn individual skills. Over time, you will
> learn to combine these skills in ways that improve your moods and your life.

The answer is: individual skills, and then skills combinations.

---

On "how to use/read the book":

> [...], it is important for you to complete the exercises in each chapter. Even
> some of the skills that look easy can be more complicated than they seem when
> you actually try to do them.

> In the beginning, [...] spend some time on these skills every day. [...] set
> aside a regular time each day to read about or practice *Mind Over Mood*
> skills.

> *Mind Over Mood* can be customized so that you can read chapters in an order
> that is likely to be most helpful to you. For example, if you have chosen this
> book to work on particular moods, at the end of Chapter 4, there is a
> recommendation that you read the chapters about moods (13, 14, and/or 15) that
> pertain to you.

I kind of had 2 "options":

- Work on particular mood, skip mood chapters that do not apply
- Read chapter by chapter

## Understanding Your Problems

The author gave an interesting model:

> Environment (consists of):
> - Thoughts
> - Behaviors
> - Moods
> - Physical Experiences
>
> Every parts of the environment can interact with each other.

I had a table that link "Thoughts", "Beliefs", and "Behaviors" to "Moods",
"Physical Experiences", and "Events", and the full parts were not here. It was
probably because I digged into the words within definition of CBT too deeply.

---

The way that everything is listed here looks useful. I will probably try to make
something similar:

> - Environment/life changes/situations: ...
> - Physical reactions: ...
> - Moods: ...
> - Behaviors: ...
> - Thoughts: ...

---

> With depression, physical changes often involve a slowing down -- trouble
> sleeping and feeling tired. Anxiety is usually marked by a speeding up of
> physical reactions -- racing heart, increased sweating, feeling jumpy.

> With depression, the main behavioral change is that people find it difficult
> to do things, and so they do less and often withdraw from people. [...] When
> we are anxious, avoidance is the most common change in our behavior.

> Finally, thinking is also quite different in depression and anxiety. Ben's
> thoughts illustrated depressed thinking, which tends to be negative, hopeless,
> and self-critical. Linda's thinking was typical of anxiety. It was more
> catastrophic ("I'm having a heart attack") and involved worry about specific
> future events (an airplane flight) as well as general worry ("What if things
> go wrong and I can't cope?"). Depressed thoughts often focus on the past and
> present, and anxious thoughts focus on the present and future.

## It Is The Thought That Counts

Thoughts affect mood

> Even situations you might think would create the same mood for everyone [...],
> in fact, lead to different moods because of different personal beliefs and
> meanings.

---

Thoughts also affect behavior

> Our thoughts and behaviors are usually closely related. For example, we are
> more likely to try to do something if we believe it is possible.

> On a daily basis, we all have "automatic thoughts" that influence our
> behavior. These are the words and images that pop into our heads throughout
> the day.

---

Thoughts also affect physical reactions

> We can be influenced by both present and past experiences that stretch over
> time from our childhoods to this moment.

---

Positive thinking is not the solution, changing the way you think to feel better
also is not well-sustained

> Although our thoughts affect our moods, behavior, and physical reactions,
> positive thinking is not a solution to life's problem. Most people who are
> anxious, depressed, or angry can tell you that "just thinking positive
> thoughts" is not that easy. In fact, thinking only positive thoughts is overly
> simplistic, usually does not lead to lasting change, and can lead us to
> overlook information that might be important.

## Identifying and Rating Moods

> Learning to distinguish among moods can help you choose actions designed to
> improve particular moods.

> Situations and behaviors can be described by asking yourself:
>
> - Who?
> - What?
> - When?
> - Where?
>
> Moods can be described by one word.
>
> Thoughts are words, images, and memories that go through your mind.
