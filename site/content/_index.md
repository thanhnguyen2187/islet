The name is "Th√†nh" (but often be diacritics-stripped to "Thanh" for easier
typing). I'm a Software Engineer from Hanoi, Vietnam, who worked mostly in the
backend spectrum. Please look at my resume [^resume] or LinkedIn [^linked-in] if
you need work-related informations. You might have known it as well, but my work
is also on GitHub [^github].

In my free time, apart from playing around and exploring
technologies (did I mention that I can also do frontend and DevOps and data
stuff as well?), I enjoy playing the guitar and chilling with my cat.
